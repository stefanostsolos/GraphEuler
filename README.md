# GraphEuler
Given an undirected graph of N vertices and M edges, GraphEuler checks if there is an Euler circle or path in the graph.
## Cycle or Path ?
If an Euler cycle is found, the program outputs "CYCLE".

In case there's not an Euler cycle, but an Euler path was found (from vertice u to vertice v, given that u < v), the program outputs "PATH u v".

No Euler cycle or path? The program outputs "IMPOSSIBLE"!
